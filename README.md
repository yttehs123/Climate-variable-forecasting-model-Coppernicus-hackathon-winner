# Coppernicus_project_zwolle

#What we propose

Create an AI model (using both SensHagen and Copernicus satellite data) that provides future ongoing measurements and the capability to predict future air quality within the city of Zwolle.  

#In particular, our AI model will:

- Give insight into the spatial and temporal fluctuations of emissions

- Predict areas that are most prone to hazardous values

- Function with a sparse sensor network.

The deep learning model folder holds the python notebook file for our AI model's code.
The satellite_processing python notebook file contains code documenting our process on how we analysed satellite data
The pdf report contains are overall proposal and assessment for the project
The pdf presentation is a pdf version of the presentation for our pitch showcased to the jusry.
